üéØ About The Project
HydraStrike is a Python-based platform that automates and optimizes network stress tests. It intelligently analyzes a target to identify weaknesses, then launches a coordinated, multi-vector attack. Its real-time feedback and dynamic adaptation make it a powerful tool for security professionals.

‚ú® Features
Smart Target Analysis: Automatically scans ports and services.

Dynamic Configuration: Intelligently determines the optimal attack methods.

Multi-Vector Attacks: Employs DoS and resource exhaustion techniques.

Real-Time Dashboard: A color-coded terminal interface for live statistics.

High-Performance: Multi-threaded architecture for efficient, simultaneous attacks.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get HydraStrike running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

pip package installer

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/root60/HydraStrike.git
cd HydraStrike

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

üïπÔ∏è Usage
The tool is operated via the command line. Provide a target and optional flags to customize the attack.

Command Syntax:

python HydraStrike.py <target> [options]

Options:

Flag

Description

Default

target

Required. The target's domain or IP address.

N/A

--duration

The duration of the attack in seconds.

60

--threads

üìö Additional Information
<details>
<summary><strong>View Attack Modules & How It Works</strong></summary>

Attack Modules
HTTP Flood: A layer 7 DoS attack using a high volume of GET requests.

Slowloris: A resource exhaustion attack that holds server connections open with partial requests.

TCP Flood: A low-level DoS attack that saturates the target with TCP packets.

UDP Flood: A protocol-based DoS attack that floods the target with UDP packets.

How It Works
The tool follows a simple workflow:

Analyze: Scans the target for open ports and services.

Configure: Determines the best attack methods based on the analysis.

Execute: Launches attack modules in parallel using a thread pool.

Report: Displays live statistics until the attack is stopped.
