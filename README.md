üéØ About The Project
HydraStrike is a sophisticated, Python-based attack execution platform that automates and optimizes network stress tests. It intelligently analyzes a target to identify its weaknesses and then launches a coordinated, multi-vector attack designed for maximum effectiveness. Its real-time feedback and dynamic adaptation make it a powerful tool for security professionals.

‚ú® Features
üéØ Smart Target Analysis: Automatically scans the target to find open ports and identify running services.

‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Configuration: Intelligently determines the optimal attack methods and parameters based on the target's profile.

üí£ Multi-Vector Attacks: Employs a range of attack modules including DoS and resource exhaustion techniques.

üì∫ Real-Time Dashboard: A color-coded terminal interface provides live statistics on the attack's progress.

üöÄ High-Performance: Utilizes a multi-threaded architecture to execute simultaneous attack vectors efficiently.

üíª Simple CLI: A clean and straightforward command-line interface for easy operation.

üîÑ How It Works
The tool follows a simple yet effective workflow to execute an attack.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to get HydraStrike up and running.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6+

pip (Python package installer)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/root60/HydraStrike.git
cd HydraStrike

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

üïπÔ∏è Usage
Using HydraStrike is straightforward. The primary input is the target, with optional flags to customize the attack.

Command Syntax:

python HydraStrike.py <target> [options]

Options:

Flag

Description

Default

target

Required. The target's domain or IP address.

N/A

--duration

The duration of the attack in seconds.

60

--threads

The number of threads per attack method.

Auto

Examples:

Run a standard 60-second attack:

python HydraStrike.py example.com

Run an extended 5-minute (300 seconds) attack:

python HydraStrike.py 192.168.1.100 --duration 300

Force the attack to use 200 threads per method:

python HydraStrike.py secure.server.net --threads 200

üí£ Attack Modules
HydraStrike currently includes the following attack modules:

HTTP Flood: A layer 7 DoS attack that bombards a web server with a high volume of HTTP GET requests.

Slowloris: A resource exhaustion attack that holds server connections open by sending partial HTTP requests very slowly.

TCP Flood: A low-level DoS attack that saturates the target with TCP packets, overwhelming its ability to process connections.

UDP Flood: A protocol-based DoS attack that floods the target with UDP packets, consuming network bandwidth and resources.
